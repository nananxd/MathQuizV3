  hints:
  - explanation: The sum of two cubes has 2 factors, one binomial and the other is
      trinomial. Binomial factor is the cube root of the term and the trinomial,
      factor the sum of the square of the binomial factor.
    example: 
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
  - explanation: Square the first and last terms of the binomial to create the first
      and last terms of the trinomial
    example: 
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
  - explanation: Multiply the terms of the binomial to create the middle term of
      the trinomial
    example: 
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
  - explanation: Signs are opposite
    example: 
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
  - explanation: The difference of two cubes has 2 factors, one binomial and the
      other is trinomial. Binomial factor is the cube root of the term and the trinomial
      factor is sum of the square of the binomial factor.
    example: 
    sprite: {fileID: 0}
